- Get Rid of "scene creators", or at least make them, so they just fill the scene, and the scene takes care ot everything else.

- When rendering-object store a pointer to resource, make it a pointer-pointer (or some shared_ptr/weak_ptr solution)
so if/when resoources are changed the render-object has a valid pointer to the changed resource

- CLean up tools, so is does NOT use "using vamespace std" in the HEADER

- Make sure all paths sent/read from the resource_callback use "/"   

- Make the NVVM-like pattern work neatly, as neatly as is possible
  QtRenderView -> QtRenderWidgetView
  +               QtRenderWidgetModelView
  +   _maybe_     QtRenderWidgetModel
  (all inside a QWidget Derived object)
  Code:
     class QRenderWidgetView : public QWidget, public MVVMStorage
     
     or similar, to make it less ugly

- Error Handling
  * Add exception handling for extensing throws 
  * add more throws for
       Header(s).IsContentValid()

- Make sure all supported RMV2s actually work
  * If not, add needed implementations

- Add Rome2/Attila/Tob shading (1 shader)
- Add WH3/3K shading (1 shader)
