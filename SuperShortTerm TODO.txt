FIX
- Make sure all assets are deleted when QRenderingWidget is delete
- Make sure that AddVariantMesh Works on existing QRenderingWidget

- Clean up the DxVariantMeshNode class. It inherits from DxDeformerNode, 
 and overrides its almost all its methods, maybe make just ONE DxDeformerNode class

- Make VMD work for all games
 - including the Rome2/Atilla decalling system

- Make Git Push ready. Stash the small changes in an order, that will each commit compilable

- Add/check exception handling in the VMD code and animation code, be really defensive
  - Add "IsValid()" checks to relevant classes, 

- Client Creators calls: Clean up the code called by the CLIENT,it is a mess
 - DxSceneCreator: find a way make it less messy

 - Make ""DxVmdManager::Refresh():" realoads the the whole VMD, but don't change its transform
  - ?Maybe it "refresh textures only" or "refresh meshes only"?

- (Is this important) Playlist blend-in is messed up, playes fine without blend in
 - draw the problem out on paper, check debug values
  
- Clean up the deformation in general, it is too messy

- Clean up "VariantMeshNode VmdManager::GenerateVariant()"
  - Clean up the clones (copy construction) of MeshData

- LONG TERM? Clean up The Testapp, into a viable standalone app
