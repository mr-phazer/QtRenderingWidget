 (DONE) Error Handling: missing exception throws and Header.IsContentValid().
- Initial camera positioning (needs math autozoom, fit combined bound boxes).
- SetAssetForlder usage (still pending, though you mentioned including the files in the lib so this is not needed?).
- no-texture causing models to no load (needs no-texture shader and fixing the bug where some models share loaded textures).

ADDED BY PHAZER:
- Link shaders, Cubemaps, default textyres, fonts, etc, into the .lib (using qt)
- Load these into the resource manager, using file name as id
- Figure out a way to load these seamlessly, 
  - like "calback get file", 
    - create a DxFileManager, that can look on disk, in resoucers, and finally 
    requesting files from to RPFM
